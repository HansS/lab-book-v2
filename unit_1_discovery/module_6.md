# Module 6

### Topic Description
This lesson describes how to create a dialogue between two sprites by first creating a written
dialogue.
### Objectives:
The students will be able to:
- Develop a dialogue between two or more Scratch sprites.
- Explain the reasoning behind how their dialogue works.

### Outline of the Lesson:

- Gallery walk of name projects (10 minutes)
- Assignment introduction (5 minutes)
- Develop dialogue (30 minutes)
- Student presentations (10 minutes)

### Student Activities:

- Participate in a gallery walk of name projects.
- Participate and listen to assignment introduction.
- Develop a dialogue.
- Present dialogues.

### Teaching/Learning Strategies:

- Gallery walk of name projects
- Facilitate gallery walk by giving the students an order or pattern to follow in walking around the
room (dependent on lab). Assignment introduction
    - Tell students that they’ll be making a dialogue between two or more sprites.
    - Have a sample dialogue with a student; for example,
        - Teacher: Knock-Knock
        - Student: Who’s there?
        - Teacher: Juana
        - Student: Juana who?
        - Teacher: Juana go write a program in Scratch!
        - Student: Ha ha!
    - Make a sample program using only “say _ for _ secs” blocks.
    - Ask students what was the difference between the live dialogue and the sample program?
(Answer is that in the program they are talking at the same time.)
    - Have students help you find the “wait _ sec” block. Add a few so students can see the sprites
taking turns.
    - Show students Dialogue Sample Rubric and tell them that they can create their own dialogue.
They can do their own knock-knock joke, or they can use their creativity. Develop Dialogue
    - Circulate room and help students.
- Student presentations
    - Have students volunteer to present their dialogues for the entire class.
