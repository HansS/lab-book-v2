### Teaching/Learning Strategies

- Introduction of project
    - Show rubric: Story Project Sample Rubric.
        - Emphasize that they will make a small presentation along with showing their story.
        - Emphasize that there is extra credit for the best stories.
    - Show example: cat story.sb
- Journal Entry: Brainstorm some ideas for your story. -
- Review of brainstorming
    - Split students into groups of three.
- Have students rotate so that each student will share brainstorms and receive feedback/suggestions from the other students.
- Develop the story
    - Have them first develop their story on paper.
- Scratch story project
    - Remind students of the problem solving that they did in unit 2 and that they can use that process to
develop their overall plan and algorithm; they can also make a storyboard similar to those used in unit 3.
    - Circulate room and help students with projects.
    - If students don’t know where to start
        - Suggest that they first develop their story further on paper.
    - If they have their story and don’t know where to start
        - Suggest that they make a title screen or a first scene.
    - If students get stuck, break the project into smaller parts. Have them focus on the next part that they
can complete.
    - Refer them to the rubric to make sure they know what they need to complete in order to earn the grade
that they want.
- Peer review and discussion
    - Circulate the room and make sure students understand the rubric and what they still need to accomplish to finish their project.
- Completion of Scratch story project
    - Circulate room and help students with projects.
    - Collect projects and rubrics.
    - Help students prepare their presentations.
- Presentation of stories
    - Have students complete the Peer Grading sheet.
    - Discuss the features used in the various stories. Ask students why certain things work/don’t work well.
    - To help students vote on the best, you may need to do a quick recap of the stories, i.e. Bob’s story about
Poodles.
        - Students should consider both the content and the items in the rubric in their voting.
        - If the class does not finish presentations in one day, the voting will be done the next day.
