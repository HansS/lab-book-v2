###Teaching/Learning Strategies:
- Overview of css
    - CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
    - CSS provides the formatting and style for a web page, while html provides the content. o There are three methods for inserting styles.
        - Inline styles
        - Internal style sheet
        - External style sheet
    - The basic format for a style is:  ```h1 {color:blue; Font_size:12px;}```
    - The selector is the element you want to style; each declaration consists of a property and a value; the property is the attribute you want to change and each property has a value.
    - To make it more readable you can put each declaration on a separate line.
    - Demonstrate creating a header with the inline style listed above.
    - Note that you can retrieve a css reference from http://www.w3schools.com/css/.
    - Display http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colornames.asp and
http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp as sources for choosing colors.
    - Have students suggest a few different declarations and demonstrate the results.
- Create a web page that uses inline styles.
    - Have students add a few styles to their web page.
- Sample internal style sheet.
    - Point out that inline styles should be used sparingly because they defeat the purpose of
separating the style from the content.
    - Have students view http://www.georgebenainous.com/web (html/css--basic markup). They
should view the page before and after the styling is added.
    - Point out what each piece of the styling does to the original page. Point out the format and that
the internal style sheet is included in the <head>. Also note that the style applies to the entire
page unless a specific inline style is added.
    - Talk about the fact that this is a way to do decomposition in their design process because they
can choose the content and provide the style in two separate stages. They can also then test the various style elements one at a time to verify correctness. You may want to note that this is similar to the way you can think about writing the algorithm for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich—write the instructions to work for any “bread”, any kind of peanut butter, and any kind of jelly; then the specific kinds of bread, peanut butter, and jelly can be changed according to particular taste. You could even extend this further to make it any kind of sandwich—bread, filling 1, filling 2, etc. (Note: This is an example of abstraction.)
- Movie review html/css page
    - Students create a website with one or more movie reviews. The html page will contain the
following paragraphs for each review: title, director, synopsis, review. The css stylesheet will have corresponding classes. The page will also include:
        - At least one picture
        - The name of at least one of the actors in italics
        - The background and text colors
- Share student work.
    - Guide students in sharing their work either by a gallery walk, volunteers, etc.
- Complete second html/css project
    - Note: you may choose to have students continue working on their movie project rather than start a second one if time is short.
    - Some examples of projects from which to have students choose are provided in the tutorial or have students create their own project.
- Share results of student work.
    - Guide students in sharing their work either by a gallery walk, volunteers, etc. o Have students provide feedback to their peers.
