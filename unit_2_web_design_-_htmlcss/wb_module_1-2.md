- Html page with paragraphs and headings (25 minutes)
- Html page with line breaks and horizontal lines (40 minutes)

### Student Activities

- Create a storyboard for a webpage.
- Follow along during the demo of the html editor.
- Create an html page with a title and body.
- Create an html page with paragraphs and headings.
- Create an html page with line breaks and horizontal lines.

### Teaching/Learning Strategies

- Create a storyboard for a webpage
    - Explain to students that a storyboard is a visual plan for a website. It usually consists of a series
of pages that include a rough sketch outlining the content, navigation, and design elements
of the website.
        - Have students create a storyboard for a website that includes a title, several paragraphs, and
headings for each paragraph before beginning the demo of the html editor.
- Demo of html editor
    - Display the html editor that you have chosen for the class. Point out the following html tags: head, body, title, html
    - Enter a title and a one sentence body. Demonstrate how to save the document as an html file and how to view the output page in a browser. Point out that the title appears in the bar at the top of the window. Also point out that the end tag is a necessary part of the syntax in order to tell the computer when to stop doing a particular thing.
- Follow the Codecademy tutorial that roughly follows this outline:

- Html page with a title and a body
    - Have students write a paragraph in the body section and give it a title. (Students can choose to
write about themselves or another topic of interest.)
    - Demonstrate the creation of a basic html/css page in the html editor of choice.
- Html page with paragraphs and headings
    - Have students add a second paragraph to their web page and note what happens.
    - Then have them add two lists related to their topic (favorite movies, music, hobbies, etc.) and
note what happens.
    - Guide students to notice that everything runs together no matter how they type it. o Explain the following html tags: p, h1-h6
    - Have students try inserting these new tags into their web page and note what happens.
    - Remind students that they need the end tag.
    - This is a good place to point out that html is one language that can be used to give the computer
instructions as discussed in Unit 1 and that the computer will produce exactly the output that the user indicates with the syntax provided. Html is not a programming language; it is a markup language.
- Html page with line breaks and horizontal lines
    - Explain the following html tags: br, hr
    - Have students try inserting these new tags into their web pages and note what happens.
    - Give students time to experiment and determine what combination of tags will allow them to
put their lists in a column, with each list having its own heading.
    - Point out that trying different tags and checking the output is an example of testing and
verification. If the output is not what is intended, then they need to debug the code they wrote.
    - Note that you can retrieve an html reference from http://www.w3schools.com/html/
