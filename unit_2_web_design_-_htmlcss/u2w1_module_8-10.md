###Topic Description
Explore the concept of separating style from structure by keeping separate html and css files. Complete weekly project

###Objectives
The student will be able to
- Create an html page which links to a separate css file.
- Use html tags and css styling elements to separate style from structure.
- Complete a project for their portfolio

###Outline of the Lesson
- Review of html/css concepts and description of how to link to a separate css file (15 minutes)
- Sample web content (20 minutes)
- Creation of separate html and css pages for the previous movie review project (40 minutes)
- Creation of separate html and css pages for a second project (75 minutes)
- Share student work (15 minutes)

###Student Activities:
- Review html/css concepts.
- Examine sample web content.
- Complete html/css movie review project.
- Complete html/css project 2.
- Share completed projects.

###Teaching/Learning Strategies:
- Review of html/css concepts
    - Guide a discussion of the highlights of the previous lesson.
    - Using the text editor, demonstrate how to create an external file for the styles. Emphasize that
whatever the name of the style sheet, it needs to have a .css extension. Save the file in the web
folder.
    - Note that this allows designers to further separate the style from the content. Such separation
would be particularly useful in maintaining a large website that has a standard look and feel. That standard look and feel can be added to a page by just include the external css file. By utilizing reusable code, there is consistency and it means that the designer does not need to retype the entire content of the style every time a new page is added.
- Sample web content
    - Answer questions as students view and read the html/css reusable code section at

- Complete html/css movie review project.
    - Have students revise their previous movie review project to use an external css file.
